2. **Delete Activity:** Activities can be deleted based on their index.
3. **Display All Activities:** View the details of all activities.
4. **Display Best Activities:** Find the best activities to be selected for a given process using a multilayered approach.
5. **List Copied:** Display a copied list of activities.
